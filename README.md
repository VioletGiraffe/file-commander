### Contributing

***Cloning the repository***

   The main git repository has submodules, so you need to execute the `update_repository` script (available as .bat for Windows and .sh for Linux / Mac) after cloning file-commander to clone the nested repositories. Subsequently, you can use the same `update_repository` script at any time to pull incoming changes to the main repo, as well as to all the subrepos, thus updating everything to the latest revision.

***Building***

* A compiler with C++ 17 support is required.
* Qt 5.12 or newer required.
* Windows: you can build using either Qt Creator or Visual Studio for IDE. Visual Studio 2015 or newer is required - v140 toolset or newer. Run `qmake -tp vc -r` to generate the solution for Visual Studio. I have not tried building with MinGW, but it should work as long as you enable C++ 14 support.
* Linux: `cd` to directory with project, run `qmake -r` to generate Makefile and build via `make -j`.
* Mac OS X: You can use either Qt Creator (simply open the project in it) or Xcode (run `qmake -r -spec macx-xcode` and open the Xcode project that has been generated). Or you an build from command line with `qmake -r` followed by `make -j`.
